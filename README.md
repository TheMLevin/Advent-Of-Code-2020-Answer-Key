# Advent Of Code 2020 Answer Key
 
Hello. My name is Mark Levin and this is my 2020 Advent of Code Answer Key.
You can easily host it on AWS Amplify yourself, or you can visit the version that I host at https://main.d9xy9j1zqokx9.amplifyapp.com/
You can also host it locally using the commands "npm run build" and "npm run start" in the command line. It will host on port 3000.
All you have to do to use it is input which challenge you want to solve and what your input is for that challenge.
I made this project to practice JS and React, as well as to better understand the web-hosting services provided by AWS.
